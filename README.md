# Nyckelharpa

A nyckelharpa is a Swedish "keyed fiddle" sort of similar to a fiddle but with 12 sympathetic strings and 4 melody strings. The sympathetic strings give the instrument a ringy sound that is kind of haunting and nice. It is a bowed instrument where the length of the strings is changed by using keys and tangents instead of your fingertips like you would on a fiddle.

This repo is an interactive map showing data about what we know of the different iterations of the nyckelharpa over the centuries. It is meant to be part of a presentation I am working on for our local library. 

For more information about nyckelharpas (in English, anyway), please visit the [American Nyckelharpa Association](http://www.nyckelharpa.org/).
